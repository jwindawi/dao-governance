# DAO Governance Research and Samples

This repository captures both my academic research into protocol-centric governance as well as the ways I put that research into practice as the Governance Lead for Rook DAO. 

### Research

My initial approach to blockchain governance was through my dissertation research. That project (completed 2021) examined blokchain as a potential form of general purpose technology, and asked how such a technology diffuses in its early stages. I answered this broad question by focusing on the social organization of individual projects, and more specifically on the technology's implications for organizational structure and governance.  

This background provided a platform for my more recent work for Rook DAO, where I have used a combination of desk research as well as user and participant research as core inputs into refining the governance process.

### DAO practice 

As Governance Lead at Rook DAO, I have pursued two missions: developing research-driven improvements to the process while stewarding the current governance process. What follows are work samples from each of these aspects of my work for Rook.
