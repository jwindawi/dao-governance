# DAO Governance Research and Samples

This repository captures both my academic research into protocol-centric governance as well as the ways I put that research into practice as the Governance Lead for Rook DAO. 

### Academic research

My initial approach to blockchain governance was through my dissertation research. That project (completed 2021) examined blokchain as a potential form of general purpose technology, and asked how such a technology first diffuses in its early stages. I answered this broad question by focusing specifically on the social organization of individual projects, and more specifically on the blend of organizational structure, governance and applications of the technology.
