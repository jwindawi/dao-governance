# Governance Research and Samples

This repository captures both my academic research into protocol-centric governance as well as the ways I put that research into practice as the Governance lead for Rook DAO. 

### Academic research: 

[Paper on polycentric dimensions of protocol governance](https://github.com/jwindawi/governance/blob/main/windawi_governance_paper.pdf)
[On blockchains as blending private and public goods](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4152068) (with J. Grimmelmann)


### Some work samples from Rook: 

[On the protocol and the DAO co-creating public goods](https://web.archive.org/web/20221202185030/https://www.notion.so/rook-labs/Governance-19f4b270e4b44648ae0671f8a964dda6?p=74a458dcd7204bb29e105897527b24e4&pm=s)
